# gitrelease-py
`gitrelease-py` is a command line utility for managing release branches in git. It is meant to aid in the construction and management of ephemeral release branches. Branches can be added and removed, at will, from a release and the CLI will rebuild the release branch by iteratively merging the branches defined in the release.
